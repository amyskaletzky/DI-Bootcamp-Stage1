            <p><strong>Princess Merida</strong> is a Scottish princess from the kingdom of DunBroch, the daughter of
                Queen Elinor and King Fergus, and
                the older sister
                of Harris, Hubert, and Hamish. Headstrong and intrepid, Merida challenged her kingdom's longstanding
                traditions to live
                a life of independence. <br>Merida is a very bold, brave, daring, courageous, stubborn, rebellious, and
                headstrong girl who does not fit the
                stereotypical princess role. <br>Rather than being a damsel in distress who is subservient to the
                customs,
                traditions, and
                social restrictions her society places on her and expects her to follow, Merida openly rebels and defies
                her heritage as
                a princess and would like for nothing more than to be a normal girl.<br> She is very athletic and enjoys
                nothing more than
                riding her horse Angus and practicing her archery, of which she is the best in the kingdom. She also
                seems to be skilled
                in sword fighting, as shown in the Brave featurette "Cutting the Class".</p>
